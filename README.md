## Description

This game allows you to deep dive into a world of lonelyness. You end up being stuck in a ruin, in which you need to find the exit for.
During your journey, you will encounter some visitors, good or bad is purely a matter of opinion. 
You might also find useful items, that help you preceed your goals.

## Installation

<!--
Write your code documentation or examples here. If your library is documented in
the source code, direct users there. If not, list your API and describe it well
in this section. If your library is passive and has no API, simply omit this
section.
-->
You can simply download the entire repository and throw it onto your local webserver.

**Note**: Potential API Keys and Logins for Databases are removed, in which you might encounter errors along the way.
In order to avoid that, please read the used elements documentation on how to receive the required information.
I will not post a guide on how to create an API key for an API nor how to connect to a MYSQL Database with PHP.
